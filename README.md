## About me

Seasoned software developer with over ten years of experience in full-stack web development and systems architecture. I have worked on platforms ranging from mobile to web and desktop.

My current interests are Blockchain technologies, smart contracts, automation, and IT infrastructure. I got certified in Solidity development by ConsenSys Academy Online Developer Program in 2018.

I consider myself to be a hard-working generalist who operates autonomously and has high-risk tolerance.
